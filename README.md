# Welcome to the CipherOS maintainership requirements

The use of “MUST”, "MUST NOT" and “SHOULD” is per the IETF standard defined in RFC2119.

## Device requirements:
* Your Cipher build must be stable
* All hardware features must work (exceptions fine, like VoLTE for legacy devices)
* Selinux must be enforcing (exceptions fine)
* Your kernel must not include any kind of overclocking
* Your kernel should be upstreamed to the latest android common kernel version
* Your device must not include any magisk module integration

## Maintainer requirements:
* You must have a proper git knowledge
* You must release one unofficial build before
* You must release each month an update before the 20th (exceptions fine)

## Tree requirements:
* Your trees must have a clean commit history
* Your commits must be properly named
* You must work on your trees. We don't want to see just a bringup commit

<br />
If you fulfill all these requirements open an issue in this repo
